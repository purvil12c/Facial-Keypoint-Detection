# Facial-Keypoint-Detection
I am working on a project to detect 15 facial keypoints. I will be using convolutional neural networks to achieve high accuracy. I aim to incorporate my neural network model with open cv in order to capture live images from the webcam feed then identifying the key points using the neural net and then applying some filters to the image. 
# Single-Hidden-Layer Model
You can find the jupyter notebook for my single-hidden layer model. I trained the neural net for 1000 epochs with 100 nodes in the hidden layer. While experimenting, I found that there was no significant difference between the accuracy achieved when training with 100 epoch and that with 1000 epoch. To improve the accuracy of my model, I am working towards a CNN model.
# CNN MODEL 
You can find the jupyter notebook for CNN model. The model has 3 convolutional layers and 2 fully-connected layers.
