# Facial-Keypoint-Detection
I am working on a project to detect 15 facial keypoints. I will be using convolutional neural networks to achieve high accuracy. I aim to incorporate my neural network model with open cv in order to capture live images from the webcam feed then identifying the key points using the neural net and then applying some filters to the image.
